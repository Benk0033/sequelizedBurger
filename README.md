# Eat-Teh-Burgers! (Sequelize)

Link to live application: https://infinite-sierra-43088.herokuapp.com/

This application is essentially a burger logger utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize (yum!). It also follows the MVC design pattern.

* Eat-Teh-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Just type the burger of your choice into the textbox.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Users also have the option to `Undevour it!` after it has moved to the right side of the page.
